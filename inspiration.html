            <h2 class="title-s">Olafur ELiasson</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olafur Eliasson is a Conceptual Danish-Icelandic artist concerned with sensorial experience and perception. Through installations, public projects, films, photography, and paintings, Eliasson activates the senses of his viewers in immersive artworks, as seen in his The Weather Project (2003) installation at the Turbine Hall of the Tate London.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to expose and evaluate the fact that the seeing and sensing process is a system that should not be taken for granted as natural—it's a cultivated means of reality production that, as a system, can be negotiated and changed,” the artist stated.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He used rich and vivid colors in installation art, which made his works full of strong emotional color. As a viewer, you can experience the atmosphere he created. His way of matching colors can influence me very much. I also like to use rich colors in my own works of art. In the process of creating both of my visual arts and media arts summatives, I researched about the relationship between colour and people’s emotion, and then incorporate a vivid colour scheme in my works.</p>

            <h2 class="title-s">Paul Klee</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paul Klee was a Swiss-born artist. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory, published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture in Germany. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really like Paul Klee’s artworks. I can stared at them for a really long time. And I studied how he use colours in his painting. How he adjust the hue, satuaration of britness in between each shapes in his painting. I learned a lot of useful pratical method of how to use the colour theory in painting. And I tried to make my own artworks look colourful and harmonious. In both of my visual arts and media arts projects, I used abstract shapes and vivid colours to express my emotion while creating the artworks.</p>

            <h2 class="title-s">Henri Matisse</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henri Émile Benoît Matisse was a French artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Pablo Picasso, as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intense colorism of the works he painted between 1900 and 1905 brought him notoriety as one of the Fauves (wild beasts). Many of his finest works were created in the decade or so after 1906, when he developed a rigorous style that emphasized flattened forms and decorative pattern. In 1917, he relocated to a suburb of Nice on the French Riviera, and the more relaxed style of his work during the 1920s gained him critical acclaim as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting. After 1930, he adopted a bolder simplification of form. When ill health in his final years prevented him from painting, he created an important body of work in the medium of cut paper collage.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have wathced a BBC documentory talking about his life and his passion for art. I was so insipied when I saw him doing collage while sitting on a wheel chair. He can quickly and fluently cut the colored paper into abstract and beautiful shapes, and reassemble them to make a vivid but harmonious collage. The combination of structure and color in his works seems to be casual and free, but in fact, it can be studied very carefully. I reserched how he incorporate these bright colours in his artworks while create a sense of vitality. Through my research, I also use rich and bright colors in my own works. I realize the fact that he worked until his old age, and I admire his passion and love for art. I hope I can do what I love all my life like him, stick to it, and influence the public through my works of art.</p>

            <h2 class="title-s">Andy Warhol</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andy Warhol was a leading figure in the Pop Art movement. Like his contemporaries Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg, Warhol responded to mass-media culture of the 1960s. His silkscreens of cultural and consumer icons—including Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Campbell’s Soup Cans, and Brillo Boxes—would make him one of the most famous artists of his generation. “The best thing about a picture is that it never changes, even when the people in it do,” he once explained. Born Andrew Warhola on August 6, 1928 in Pittsburgh, PA, he graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1949. Moving to New York to pursue a career in commercial illustration, the young artist worked for magazine such as Vogue and Glamour. Though Warhol was a gay man, he kept much of his private life a secret, occasionally referencing his sexuality through art. This is perhaps most evident in his drawings of male nudes from the 1950s, and later in his film Sleep (1963), which portrays the poet John Giorno nude. In 1964, Warhol rented a studio loft on East 47th street in Midtown Manhattan which was later known as The Factory. The artist used The Factory as a hub for movie stars, models, and artists, who became fodder for his prints and films. The space also functioned as a performance venue for The Velvet Underground. During the 1980s, Warhol collaborated with several younger artists, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Francesco Clemente, and Keith Haring. The artist died tragically following complications from routine gall bladder surgery at the age of 58, on February 22, 1987 in New York, NY. After his death, the artist’s estate became The Andy Warhol Foundation and in 1994, a museum dedicated to the artist and his oeuvre opened in his native Pittsburgh. Today, his works are held in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Tate Gallery in London, among others. A major retrospective of Warhol's work took place at the Whiney Museum of Art in New York in 2019.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like his bright, colourful paintings and prints of subjects ranging from celebrities including Marilyn Monroe and Mohammed Ali, to everyday products such as cans of soup and Brillo pads. But behind these iconic images are some surprising approaches and ideas. I also like the way he satirizes consumerism with his works. He didn't express his dislike of consumerism directly in language, but in the form of art, expressing ideas in the way he is good at, which I admire very much. He uses his unique way of art to make fast consuming things stay. Stay on the walls of the exhibition hall, stay in the history, and constantly make the public reflect. He let me find that art can be humorous and absurd, it can be fun. I like his style of banter very much. I think it's the biggest impact he's had on me. That is to find that art can be played, it is actually very fun. In my visual works, I also make people realize the labels and stereotypes that often exist in the society by interacting and playing with the public.</p>
